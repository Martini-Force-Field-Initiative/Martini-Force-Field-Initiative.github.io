### Introduction {#introduction}

<hr>

As explained in the [backward tutorial](../Backward/index.qmd), to convert a coarse-grained (CG) structure to an atomistic (AT) level of detail, knowledge of the arrangements of atoms that correspond to the particle is needed. `CG2AT`<sup>\[1\]</sup> is one such programme that does that using a fragment-based methodology that contains all the chemical and stereochemical information required to assemble the system. To improve the protein output, optionally an atomistic structure for the protein within the system can be provided, which `CG2AT` steers the *de novo* structure (that produced from just the CG information) to fit to, often improving the secondary structure (see **Figure 1**). At the end of the workflow, the user will have the necessary files to launch an AT simulation with `gromacs`. <br>

**Figure 1: The CG2AT workflow.** (A) Fragment file for phenylalanine. Each fragment has a header containing the corresponding CG bead name, for example, backbone \[BB\], side chain \[SC1\], and so on, followed by the atoms within the fragment. If the molecule is not processed by pdb2gmx, then the atom numbers should match the supplied topology itp file. (B) Topology file for phenylalanine. There are six sections within the topology file: CONNECT details the connectivity of the backbone and should follow a four-column convention: bead name, associated atom name, connected bead name, and numeric direction of the connected bead. GROUPS contain the fragment groupings, as shown in the (C) “Grouped” section. N\_TERMINAL and C\_TERMINAL contain any non-standard atomistic termini for the residue. CHIRAL contains any stereochemistry information present within the residue. This is described in the column format: central atom, atom to move, atom 1, atom 2, and atom 3\. (C) Graphical depiction of the grouped (left) and modular (right) methodologies implemented within CG2AT, where atomistic fragments are either grouped and aligned with their CG beads or aligned individually in a modular fashion. (D) Description of the conversion of CG to AT. Initially, CG2AT converts the CG system in a de novo manner from the fragments supplied. If an atomistic protein structure is provided, this structure is aligned with the CG coordinates, with the de novo protein coordinates steered to the aligned protein coordinates to remove clashes with surrounding atoms, for example, lipids.

### Overview and Required Tools {#overview-and-required-tools}
<hr>

**Requirements**  

> ***Software*** 
> 
> - Python v3 or higher  
> - GROMACS \> v5  
> 
> ***Non-standard python modules*** 
> 
> - Numpy  
> - Scipy

`CG2AT` does not require compilation and can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/pstansfeld/cg2at) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/5076091), which is ready to use. However, it can also be installed via the command line. This can be achieved using: 

```bash
pip3 install cg2at
```

Or 

```bash
conda install -c stansfeld_rg cg2at
```

The addition of `CG2AT` to the system PATH will make using the programme easier. To do this, in either your .profile, .bashrc or .zshrc file, you can add the following line:

```bash
export PATH="path_to_CG2AT2:$PATH"
```
where `path_to_CG2AT2` is replaced with the installation path for CG2AT. This will enable you to run the commands as shown in the tutorial.

### Tutorial {#tutorial}
<hr>

In theory, `CG2AT` can convert between a large range of force fields and their iterations (see the [GitHub](https://github.com/pstansfeld/cg2at) page and publication<sup>\[1\]</sup> for more information) to others, but in this tutorial, the focus will be on the charmm36m atomistic force field and Martini 3\. 

The outputs from the [Proteins IIa](../ProteinsIIa/index.qmd) KALP tutorial will be used, and all of the files for this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/0_Tutorials/m3_tutorials/cg2at/tutorial_files.tar.gz).

```bash
tar -xzf tutorial_files.tar.gz
cd tutorial_files
```

To make the conversion from CG to AT (assuming that the fragments are present within `CG2AT`), all that is needed as input is the CG coordinate file. An additional file of the AT protein structure can be provided to obtain an aligned file (see **Figure 1**). 

From the downloaded files, we will use the final frame of the simulation, `dynamic.gro` and the initial KALP structure, `kalp-AA.pdb`. We are then ready to perform the `CG2AT` conversion using the following command:

```bash
cg2at -c dynamic.gro -a kalp-AA.pdb -ff charmm36-jul2020-updated \
 -fg martini_3-0_charmm36 -w tip3p
```

The `-c` flag is for the CG coordinates, `-a` is for the AT protein structure, `-ff` will select the atomistic force field to map to, `-fg` will select the coarse-grained forcefield the supplied file is in and `-w` will select the water model to use in the AT system.

:::{.callout-tip}
The command used can be simplified to
```bash
cg2at -c dynamic.gro 
```
which will prompt selection of the force fields and water model, and only provide the *de novo* protein structure.
:::

The script will run through the following steps before producing the final atomistic system (which can be seen in **Figure 1D**):

- Initialisation
- Read in CG system
- Build protein systems
- Build non-protein system
- Merge and minimise *de novo*
- NVT on *de novo*
- Creating aligned system

Depending on the size of your system, this command can take a while to complete, but should be relatively quick for this example. It will produce a file called `CG2AT_`*`date`*`_`*`time`* in your working directory. This contains multiple sub-folders for the different mapping and minimisation steps. 

:::{.callout-note}
If the programme fails, in each folder (and any sub-folders) the `gromacs-outputs` file will record if there are any warnings/errors.
:::

The folder of the most interest is the `FINAL` folder, which contains the `final_cg2at_aligned.pdb` (and the *de novo* version), the `.ff` folder, relevant `.itp` files (including position restraint files) and the topology file `topol_final.top`. Additionally, within this folder, the `script_timings.dat` will provide information about how long each step takes. We can look at the final structure:

```bash
cd CG2AT_date_time/FINAL/
vmd final_cg2at_aligned.pdb
```

The system should look like that on the right in **Figure 2** after adjusting the visualisation selections.

The right shows the AT conversion, with the protein shown as a cartoon, lipids and sticks (with hydrogens hidden for clarity) and solvent as a transparent blue surface.

</br>
The atomistic system is now ready to simulate. Still working within the `FINAL` folder, we can perform an energy minimisation, an equilibration with position restraints and finally a short production run. The `.mdp` files are modified from [Justin Lemkul's gromacs tutorials](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/)<sup>\[2\]</sup>, which are a fantastic resource for an introduction to atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. For our system, we can run:

```bash
#First energy minimisation
gmx grompp -f ../../mdp_files/em.mdp -c final_cg2at_aligned.pdb -p topol_final.top -o em.tpr

gmx mdrun -deffnm em -v -nt 4

#Now an equilibration step with position restraints
gmx grompp -f ../../mdp_files/eq.mdp -c em.gro -r em.gro -p topol_final.top -o eq.tpr

gmx mdrun -deffnm eq -v -nt 4

#A short production run
gmx grompp -f ../../mdp_files/md.mdp -c eq.gro -p topol_final.top -o md.tpr

gmx mdrun -deffnm md -v -nt 4
```

:::{.callout-warning}
This is not intended to be a guide to the best practices for atomistic simulations, but an idea of how the outputs from `CG2AT` can be used. Please see [Justin Lemkul's gromacs tutorials](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/)<sup>\[2\]</sup> as a more comprehensive guide.
:::

On a decent workstation, this simulation will take ~15 minutes to run, but it is for illustration purposes only. The simulation time can be shortened by reducing the number of steps in the `md.mdp` file. The simulation can be visualised using:

```bash
vmd md.gro md.xtc
```

To improve visualisation, the perodic issues can be fixed using the following commands (for example, but there are many ways to do this):

```bash
gmx trjconv -f md.xtc -s md.tpr -pbc whole -center -o md_whole.xtc # then select protein

vmd md.gro md_whole.xtc
```

Hope you enjoy converting your CG systems!

### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}
<hr>
To try and solve any issues, the best port of call is the [GitHub](https://github.com/pstansfeld/cg2at) page for further guidance, but some issues are discussed here.


<details>
<summary>
Fragment is not in the database
</summary>
One of the most common errors is that a fragment is not part of the database. There are multiple things to check: 

1. The first thing to check is that you are selecting the correct CG force field with the `CG2AT` command. 

2. Next, you can check the fragments that are present in the database. These can be found in the `CG2AT` installation, or by looking on the [GitHub](https://github.com/pstansfeld/cg2at) page. The (non-protein or solvent) fragments (for martini_3-0_charmm36, for example) will be found in `cg2at/database/fragments/martini_3-0_charmm36/non_protein`. The residue name needs to match exactly for this to be recognised by `CG2AT`.

3. If the fragment is not in the database, new fragments can be added by the user, which is useful for small molecules or less commonly encountered lipids, for example. The files needed to add a molecule/fragment to the database are:

- `FRAG.pdb` (specific format, see below)
- `FRAG.itp` (standard atomistic .itp file for the specified force field)
- `FRAG_posre.itp` (position restraint file for the non-hydrogen atoms of the fragment)
- `FRAG.top` *optional* (contains the information about grouping, connectivity and chirality). A small example can be seen in **Figure 1B**.

The supplied `.pdb` file contains information about which atoms belong to which particles, and the atomistic relative position in space. The format for the atomistic part is a standard `.pdb` style. For example, this small molecule called 4HPA, which you can see below. This shows that atoms 1,2 and 18 belong to the `BB` bead etc. It is important **all** atoms are listed, including hydrogens.

These files would then be added to a folder with the name of your fragment (i.e. FRAG) in the `cg2at/database/fragments/martini_3-0_charmm36/non_protein` folder. When you run `CG2AT` again, the warning should be gone.

:::{.callout-warning}
Currently, the most recent [Martini 3 lipidome](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00755) lipids are not included in the database, so it would require manual inclusion by the user. The Martini 3 lipids released with the initial force field are included.
:::

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Issue finding information for residue: CYSD
</summary>
This is an issue with some combinations of selected force fields. It originates from a mismatch in the naming with the deprotonated CYS and those present in the selected `aminoacids.rtp`.
The combination used in the tutorial can bypass this issue, but it is intended to be fixed overall.
</details>


<details>
<summary>
CUDA error
</summary>
Occasionally, you could get something similar to a CUDA error. The flag `-ncpus` can change the number of cores it utilises.
