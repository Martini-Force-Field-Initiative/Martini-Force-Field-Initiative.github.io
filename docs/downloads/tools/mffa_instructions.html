	<h1>Gromacs/MFFA</h1>
	<p>Gromacs/MFFA is a customised <a href="http://www.gromacs.org">Gromacs</a> 
	version that supports user-defined, implicit, mean-field force approximation 
	(<a href="#mffa">MFFA</a>) boundary potentials. It offers a computationally efficient method to 
	simulate e.g. large vesicular systems in spherical liquid droplets.</p>
	
	<p>Gromacs/MFFA was originally written by Jelger Risselada for Gromacs 3.1.4 
	and has been subsequently ported e.g. to Gromacs 4 by Martti Louhivuori.
	The <a href="#download">current version</a> is stable (at least in the machines we have used) and 
	suitable for production runs (AFAIK), but since Gromacs/MFFA is still under 
	active development one should always 
	<span class="huom">carefully validate all results</span> obtained by it.
	For instructions on how to use it, see <a href="#howto">below</a>.</p>

	<p>The current maintainer of Gromacs/MFFA is Martti Louhivuori. 
	If you have any suggestions / bug reports, please send a sufficiently 
	detailed description to

	<a name="mffa"><h2>Mean-field force approximation</h2></a>
	<p>A mean-field force approximation (MFFA) potential is an implicit 
	interaction potential that mimics a bulk solvent phase. It is intended to 
	match the effective, net interaction a particle would feel from the solvent 
	particles replaced by the potential.</p>
	
	<p>Brooks and Karplus showed [1] that such a mean-field potential can be 
	readily calculated from the radial distribution function (RDF) of a pure 
	liquid system. The exact form of the MFFA potential depends on the geometry 
	of the boundary, but e.g. for a Lennard-Jones liquid it has the same kind of 
	attractive and repulsive regimes as the LJ-potential.</p>

	<p>The main advantage of replacing part of the explicit solvent with an 
	implicit MFFA potential is, of course, computational efficiency. It is 
	trivial to show that e.g. for a spherical system the number of particles 
	increases cubicly with an increase in the radius of the system. In practice 
	this means that one spends a relatively large proportion of computational 
	resources on the (less important) bulk solvent surrounding the system of 
	interest. An enveloping MFFA potential allows one to use a thinner bulk 
	layer of explicit solvent, and thus improves computational efficiency 
	dramatically. MFFA boundary potentials have been shown [2] to also have
	sometimes other secondary advantages e.g. through a molding effect to 
	speed up spontaneous formation of lipid vesicles. It is also possible to 
	create a pressure gradient across a vesicle e.g. by coupling two independent 
	MFFA potentials (one inside and one outside) to different ambient 
	pressures.</p>

	<a name="howto"><h2>Quick HOW-TO</h2></a>

	<h3>1) Prepare RDF</h3>
	<p>Set-up and run an equilibrium simulation of a pure liquid system under the 
	same environmental conditions that you wish to use for the MFFA simulation. 
	Of course, you need to use a large enough simulation box and run for long 
	enough to achieve proper statistics for a good quality RDF. Once done, use 
	<span class="komento">g_rdf</span> to obtain the actual solvent-solvent 
	RDF:</p>

	<div class="terminaali">
		<!--		<div class="shell">in bash:</div>-->
		<span>echo 0 0 | g_rdf -f traj.xtc -s topol.tpr -o rdf.xvg -bin 0.001</span>
	</div>

	<h3>2) Prepare simulation system</h3>
	<p>Set-up the actual simulation system that you want to run with 
	Gromacs/MFFA. E.g. to simulate something in a spherical droplet of water 
	instead of the normal periodic box, you need to surround the (periodic) 
	system with a spherical water shell of required dimensions.	This is readily 
	done using <span class="komento">editconf</span>, 
	<span class="komento">genbox</span>, and a Python-script called 
	<span class="komento">clean-sphere.py</span> 
	(available from <a href="http://md.chem.rug.nl/~mara/softa/">here</a>).</p>

	<p>So, first edit the box to be large enough and center the system of 
	interest:</p>
	<div class="terminaali">
		<span>editconf -f periodic.gro -o center.gro -box 40 40 40 -c</span>
	</div>
	<p>Note: the box dimensions should be at least couple of nm larger than the 
	actual size of droplet. This is to ensure that there is no "tunneling" 
	through the MFFA potential in combination with the periodic boundaries that 
	will still be turned on for computational efficiency. Since this won't 
	have a negative effect on the performance of the MD engine, you may just as 
	well use a relatively large vacuum to avoid any "tunneling" events.</p>

	<p>Then solvate the rest of the box (van der Waals radius is increased 
	for Martini CG water):</p>
	<div class="terminaali">
		<span>genbox -cp center.gro -cs water.gro -o solvated.gro -vdwd 0.235</span>
	</div>
	<p>And then remove all water that is beyond the MFFA boundary to make a nice, 
	round water droplet:</p>
	<div class="terminaali">
		<span>python clean-sphere.py W 15.0 solvated.gro -o droplet.gro</span>
	</div>
	<p>If using a different solvent than CG water, you need to replace "W" with 
	the correct residue name.</p>

	<h3>3) Calculate MFFA</h3>
	<p>Once you have your system defined, you need to prepare a matching MFFA 
	boundary that will envelope the droplet. This is simple to do, but may 
	require a little bit of trial and error to get the dimensions correct 
	(we'll come back to this in step 5).</p>

	<p>The easiest way to prepare a MFFA boundary potential for a Lennard-Jones 
	type solvent (such as Martini CG water), is to use the tool 
	<span class="komento">g_mffa</span> included in Gromacs/MFFA. For our 30nm 
	diameter water droplet, this would be done with the command:
	<div class="terminaali">
		<span>g_mffa -f rdf.xvg -o mffa.sdb -quench -inner 0 -outer 15 -center 20 20 20 -rho RHO</span>
	</div>
	<p>where RHO is the number density of the solvent (step 1). If using a 
	different solvent than Martini CG water, it may be necessary to change some 
	of the other parameters as well (such as the van der Waals radius of solvent 
	particles, the LJ parameters, interaction cut-off etc.). The 
	<span class="optio">-quench</span> option selects the type of the boundary 
	potential:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>SPHERE -- spherical boundary potential</li>
		<li>QUENCH -- spherical boundary that is coupled to an external pressure bath</li>
		<li>LINEAR -- wall-like boundary</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>4) Set-up simulation parameters</h3>
	<p>Next, you'll need to set up system topology (.top), MD parameters 
	(.mdp) etc. just as you would do for a normal simulation. The only change 
	you need to do is to set the following options in the .mdp file:</p>
	<div class="optiot">
		<span># inner cavity growth rate</span><br>
		userreal1 = 0.000<br>
		<span># softness of pressure coupling</span><br>
		userreal2 = 1000<br>
		<span># SD friction</span><br>
		userreal3 = 60<br>
		<span># random generator seed (half-sphere if neg., sphere if pos.)</span><br>
		userreal4 = 813451<br>
		<span># apply pressure coupling also on the inner cavity (1=ON, 0=OFF)</span><br>
		<span># if set to 2, the internal cavity pressure is calculated from the virial</span><br>
		userint1 = 0
	</div>
	
	<h3>5) Test and fine tune MFFA</h3>
	<p>Once everything is ready, you should run a short (few ns) simulation to 
	equilibrate (at least roughly) the system with the MFFA boundary. If all 
	goes well, the boundary doesn't need to contract/expand too much, but will 
	only fluctuate around the original radius, and you are set to go for longer 
	simulations.</p>

	<p>If you observe a clear shrinking/expanding of the boundary, i.e. the 
	position (=radius) of the potential (the third line in the .sdb file) 
	changed by more than, let's say, a nanometer, then you should go back to 
	step 3 and re-calculate a more proper MFFA potential; i.e. use the final 
	radius of the short run as the <span class="optio">-outer</span> radius of 
	the new MFFA potential. Repeat until you have a MFFA potential that 
	corresponds (roughly) to the geometry of the equilibrated droplet.</p>

	<p>The main difference from running normal Gromacs is that you need to 
	provide at least one MFFA potential (.sdb) to 
	<span class="komento">mdrun</span> using the <span class="optio">-sb</span> 
	option.</p>
	
	<div class="terminaali">
		<span>mdrun -sb common.sdb</span>
	</div>

	<p>If you have multiple potentials (e.g. a fully repulsive one for lipids 
	to prevent them sticking to the boundary) you need to supply them like this: 
	<span class="optio">-sb "one.sdb#two.sdb"</span> and also provide a 
	boundary-index file (.ndb) created with <span class="komento">ndx2ndb</span>
	(included in Gromacs/MFFA). 
	The order of the potentials is decided by the order in which you picked the 
	groups in <span class="komento">ndx2ndb</span>. 

	<div class="terminaali">
		<span>mdrun -sb "water.sdb#lipid.sdb" -nb index.ndb</span>
	</div>

	<h3>6) Go! Go!</h3>
	<p>Finally, you can run long production simulations to study the next BIG 
	THING&trade;...</p>
