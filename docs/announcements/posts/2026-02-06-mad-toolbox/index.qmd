A new preprint is now available, “Extending the MAD Toolbox: New Polymer Builder and Enhanced Martini Database”. It describes major updates to the MArtini Database (MAD) web server, including a Polymer Builder for automated construction of polymer models and expanded MAD tools/database support for modern Martini workflows (e.g., improved molecule building and broader model coverage).
