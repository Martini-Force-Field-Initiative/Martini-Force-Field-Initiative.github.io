We are very pleased to announce the publication of _Bentopy_ in _Protein Science_. _Bentopy_ is a
workflow for building large-scale models ready for simulation. With _bentopy_ existing structures
and experimental evidence can be brought together and assembled to create starting states for large
and complex simulations, even on modest workstations.

- Read the paper at [Westendorp & Stevens, et al. Protein Science (2026)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.70480).
- Learn how to build models using _bentopy_ in our [detailed tutorial](/docs/tutorials/Martini3/Bentopy).
- In-depth documentation can be found on the [_bentopy_ wiki](https://github.com/marrink-lab/bentopy/wiki).
- _Bentopy_ is open-source software developed on our [GitHub](https://github.com/marrink-lab/bentopy) and distributed through [PyPI (pip)](https://pypi.org/project/bentopy).

The following video is a walkthrough of the tutorial.
