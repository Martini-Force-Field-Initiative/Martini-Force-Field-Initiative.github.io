## Part I. Protein complexes at equilibrium
<hr>

The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has made clear the need to characterize spike protein dynamics and binding stability at scale. Understanding how mutations affect both overall fold and specific receptor or nanobody interfaces under near-physiological conditions is essential for predicting variant infectivity and guiding therapeutic design. In this tutorial, we'll implement and compare equilibrium coarse-grained (CG) strategies using the Martini 3 force field <sup>[[1]](#references)</sup> to extend sampling to microsecond time scales without sacrificing key structural features. We then benchmark these approaches against full atomistic simulations to assess which approximation most faithfully reproduces protein flexibility at binding interfaces. We'll need a GROMACS version >= 2023.5 <sup>[[2]](#references)</sup>.

This section is not intended to capture large conformational changes. If you plan to to do so, please go to [Part II - Protein complex under conformational changes: A nanomechanical study](#part-II.-Protein-complexes-under-conformational-changes:-A-nanomechanical-study)


## Protein complex preparation
<hr>

The structure with PDB ID 6ZH9 corresponds to a ternary complex composed of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to the nanobody H11-H4 and the antibody CR3022. In this tutorial, we will focus specifically on the nanobody H11-H4, which engages the RBD at the receptor-binding interface and plays a critical role in neutralizing viral entry <sup>[[12]](#references)</sup>. All worked and template files for this tutorial can be download from [here](http://pomalab.ippt.pan.pl/web/complex1.zip). If you want to skip the below preparation, the file ready to use, `6ZH9_clean.pdb`,  is in the template folder.

1. Obtain the atomistic structure of the ternary complex from the Protein Data Bank [here](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6ZH9)

Alternatively, the file is available in the template folder

2. Before using `martinize2`, the atomistic structure must be cleaned and standardized:

* Remove water molecules and crystallographic additives, as these are not needed for GG modeling.
* Fix any missing residues or loops using your preferred modeling tool (e.g., AlphaFold2, Modeller, etc.).
* Cofactors are not handled in this tutorial. If your system includes essential cofactors, they must be treated separately.

3. Trim the system to the relevant components
The structure contains multiple chains corresponding to antibodies and the RBD. For this tutorial, retain only the RBD and nanobody:

* Delete chains HHH and LLL, which correspond to the antibody CR3022.
* Rename the remaining chain IDs for clarity:
* Change EEE to E → RBD
* Change FFF to F → H11-H4 nanobody

These modifications can be done using molecular visualization tools such as Chimera, ChimeraX, PyMOL, or VMD.

## Protein complex without a structural bias
<hr>

In this section we will generate a CG model of the RBD/H114 complex using MARTINI 3.0.1 without tertiary structure bias. We will then:

Step 1. Generate the CG topology
Step 2. Set up the simulation box
Step 3. Solvate the system
Step 4. Add ions
Step 5. Perform energy minimization
Step 6. Equilibrate under NPT conditions
Step 7. Run the production simulation

### Step 1. Generate coarse-grained topology

The cleaned PDB structure can now be used as input for martinize2 to generate both the CG structure and the corresponding Martini 3 topology file<sup>[[3]](#references)</sup>. Installation instructions for martinize2 are available online. Please note that martinize2 may not be compatible with older versions of Python; it is known to work reliably with Python versions above 3.9. To explore the available options, refer to the help function by running `martinize2 -h`. A general recommendation for any system simulated with Martini is to apply position restraints, particularly on the backbone, during the equilibration phase. This allows the side chains to relax and adjust to solvent interactions without disrupting the overall fold. To support this, `martinize2` can automatically generate a list of atoms to be restrained. A typical command for running martinize2 might look like the following:

```bash
martinize2 -f 6ZH9_clean.pdb -o topol.top -x 6ZH9_CG.pdb -dssp /path/to/dssp -p backbone -ff martini3001 -merge all -ignh
```

To run `martinize2`, we provide the input structure with the `-f` flag and specify two output files: a topology file using `-o` and a coordinate file for the structure mapped to Martini resolution using `-x`. The mapping will be done according to version 3 of the Martini force field, as indicated by the `-ff` flag.

To incorporate structural information into the CG model, we must also provide secondary structure data. Martinize2 offers several ways to supply this information:

* The -dssp option attempts to use the mdtraj Python module, which must be installed in the same environment as martinize2.

* Alternatively, -dssp /path/to/dssp will invoke a DSSP binary at the specified path to extract secondary structure information directly from the structure. This binary can be downloaded from https://github.com/cmbi/dssp/releases. It is important to use version 3.1.4 or earlier, as later versions are not compatible due to output format changes. If DSSP is installed system-wide, the typical path is /usr/bin/mkdssp.

A third option is to manually provide the secondary structure using the -ss flag followed by a DSSP-formatted string. This string must have the same number of characters as there are residues in the protein and should follow the DSSP notation:

H = α-helix,
B = residue in isolated β-bridge,
E = extended strand (β-sheet),
G = 3₁₀-helix,
I = π-helix,
T = hydrogen-bonded turn,
S = bend,
C = coil or irregular.


If everything went correctly, martinize2 will have generated three essential files: the CG structure in PDB format (.pdb), the master topology file (topol.top), and the individual protein topology file (molecule_0.itp). To proceed with running a simulation, you will need two additional files: the Martini force field topology file (typically named martini_v3.0.0.itp) and a GROMACS run parameter file (.mdp). Example versions of these files can be found on the official Martini website or in the provided template folder. Make sure to adapt the parameter settings in the .mdp file and the topology as needed for your specific system.


![alt text](AA.png "Title"){width="100%"}
Figure 1. Structural models of the RBD/H11-H4 complex. **A)** Atomistic model shown in cartoon representation. **B)** Corresponding CG model using the Martini framework.  In both panels, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is colored in blue and the nanobody H11-H4 in orange.  All representations were prepared with ChimeraX<sup>[[11]](#references)</sup>.

Once the CG model has been generated, it's important to ensure that the topology file topol.top is correctly configured for a Martini 3 simulation. This file should include the appropriate force field definitions and reference the generated protein topology. A minimal working version of topol.top should look like this:

```bash
#include "martini_v3.0.0.itp"
#include "molecule_0.itp"
#include "martini_v3.0.0_ions_v1.itp"
#include "martini_v3.0.0_solvents_v1.itp"

[ system ]
SYSTEM NAME

[ molecules ]
molecule_0    1
```


After that, we need to modify the default force constant used for position restraints in the molecule_0.itp file. By default, `martinize2` may write a placeholder such as POSRES_FC, which must be replaced with an actual numerical value. In this case, we want to set the force constant to 1000 kJ mol⁻¹ nm⁻². This can be done using sed, a command-line tool for editing files in-place. Run the following command:

```bash
sed -i 's/POSRES_FC/1000/g' molecule_0.itp
```
This command searches for all instances of POSRES_FC in the molecule_0.itp file and replaces them with 1000, ensuring that the position restraints are properly defined for use during equilibration or production runs.


### Step 2. Set up the simulation box

To prepare the system for solvation and subsequent simulation, the first step is to center the CG complex in a simulation box. We use `gmx editconf` to place the structure in the center of a cubic box with 2.0 nm of padding between the solute and the box edges. This padding ensures that the solute does not interact with its periodic images. The command is as follows:


```bash
gmx editconf -f 6ZH9_CG.pdb -bt cubic -d 2.0 -c -o 6ZH9_CG.gro
```

Here:

* -f 6ZH9_CG.pdb specifies the input structure,

* -bt cubic sets the box type to cubic,

* -d 2.0 defines the distance (in nm) between the solute and the box boundary,

* -c centers the molecule in the box,

* -o 6ZH9_CG.gro defines the output file in GROMACS .gro format.

Once the structure is centered and converted, we prepare the topology file. Make a copy of the previously edited topol.top file and rename it to system.top, which is the standard name expected in GROMACS workflows:

```bash
cp topol.top system.top
```
This ensures consistency in file naming and keeps the original topology intact for reference.

### Step 3. Solvate the system
The next step is to solvate the simulation box using Martini water beads. This is done with the `gmx solvate` command, which fills the defined box with CG water molecules while avoiding overlap with the protein structure.

Use the following command:


```bash
gmx solvate -cp 6ZH9_CG.gro -cs water.gro -radius 0.21 -o solvated.gro -p system.top
```
* -cp 6ZH9_CG.gro: specifies the centered and boxed protein structure as input.

* -cs water.gro: provides the coordinate file containing Martini water beads (usually included in the Martini package).

* -radius 0.21: sets the minimal distance (in nm) allowed between solute and solvent atoms, adapted for CG resolution.

* -o solvated.gro: defines the output structure file with water molecules added.

* -p system.top: automatically updates the topology file to include the number of added water molecules.

This command prepares the system for ion addition and energy minimization by embedding the CG complex in a fully solvated environment.

### Step 4. Add ions

To prepare the system for ion placement, we first need to generate a binary input file (.tpr) using the gmx grompp command. This step requires a minimal parameter file, typically named ions.mdp, which defines basic settings for preprocessing (e.g., cutoffs, integrator). Use the following command:

```bash
gmx grompp -f ions.mdp -c solvated.gro -p system.top -o ions.tpr -maxwarn 1
```

* -f ions.mdp specifies the parameter file.

* -c solvated.gro is the input structure after solvation.

* -p system.top is the updated topology.

* -o ions.tpr is the binary run input file used by genion.

* -maxwarn 1 allows grompp to proceed even if a minor warning is raised (e.g., due to missing velocities or box size mismatches).

Once the .tpr file is ready, ions are added to neutralize the system and set the ionic strength to 0.15 M. The `gmx genion` command replaces solvent beads with sodium (NA) and chloride (CL) beads accordingly:

```bash
echo W | gmx genion -s ions.tpr -o system_solv_ions.gro -p system.top -pname NA -nname CL -neutral -conc 0.15
```
* -s ions.tpr: input run file from grompp.

* -o system_solv_ions.gro: output structure with ions added.

* -p system.top: topology file, which is updated with the ion counts.

* -pname NA and -nname CL: specify the names of the positive and negative ions.

* -neutral: ensures overall charge neutrality.

* -conc 0.15: sets the target salt concentration to 0.15 mol/L.

This step finalizes the setup of the solvated and neutralized CG system, ready for energy minimization and equilibration.

### Step 5. Energy minimization

The final preparation step before equilibration is to perform energy minimization of the solvated and ionized system. This ensures that any steric clashes or high-energy contacts introduced during solvation and ion addition are relaxed.

First, use `gmx grompp` to generate the minimization input file (.tpr) and then, launch the minimization run using gmx mdrun:

```bash
gmx grompp -p system.top -c system_solv_ions.gro -f minimization.mdp -r system_solv_ions.gro -o minimization.tpr

gmx mdrun -deffnm minimization -v -nt 6 -pin on -gpu_id 0 -pinoffset 0
```

* -deffnm minimization: sets the base name for input/output files (e.g., minimization.log, minimization.gro, etc.).

* -v: enables verbose output.

* -nt 6: runs with 6 CPU threads.

* -pin on: enables CPU core pinning for performance consistency.

* -gpu_id 0: selects GPU 0 (optional, only applicable if GROMACS was compiled with GPU support).

* -pinoffset 0: ensures correct CPU affinity (optional; relevant for multi-GPU nodes).

### Step 6. Equilibration under NPT conditions

To stabilize the system's density and pressure under near-physiological conditions, the next step is to perform NPT equilibration. This simulation phase is carried out in the constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature ensemble. The setup involves generating a new input .tpr file and running the equilibration with `gmx mdrun`.


```bash
gmx grompp -p system.top -c minimization.gro -f npt.mdp -r minimization.gro -o npt.tpr -maxwarn 2

gmx mdrun -deffnm npt -v -nt 6 -pin on -pinoffset 0 -gpu_id 0 -nb gpu -bonded gpu -dlb auto

```

### Step 7. Production simulation
The final step is to launch the production simulation under fully equilibrated conditions. This is the stage where the system evolves freely and data are collected for analysis.

```bash
gmx grompp -p system.top -c npt.gro -f dynamic.mdp -o dynamic.tpr -maxwarn 1  -t npt.cpt

gmx mdrun -deffnm dynamic -v -nt 6 -pin on -pinoffset 0 -nb gpu -bonded gpu -dlb auto
```
## Protein complex with elastic network
<hr>

In this step, we convert the atomistic structure of the protein complex into a coarse-grained representation using the Martini 3.0.0 force field, with the addition of an elastic network model (ENM). The elastic network is a set of harmonic springs applied between backbone beads within a defined cutoff range. It preserves the native tertiary and quaternary structure by maintaining the relative distances between residues, effectively stabilizing the folded conformation during the simulation. This is particularly important for large protein complexes, where thermal fluctuations can otherwise lead to partial unfolding or loss of structural integrity in CG models <sup>[[14]](#references)</sup>.

```bash
martinize2 -f 6ZH9_clean.pdb -o topol.top -x 6ZH9_CG.pdb -dssp /path/to/dssp -p backbone -ff martini3001 -elastic -ef 700.0 -el 0.5 -eu 0.9 -ea 0 -ep 0 -merge all -ignh
```

Overwrite or modify the topology as stated above. Also modify the POSRES_FC place holder with the `sed` command previously stated.

Proceed with [steps 2 to 7](#step-2-set-up-the-simulation-box) as described in the *Protein complex without a structure bias* section. These include box setup, solvation, ion addition, energy minimization, NPT equilibration, production run, trajectory alignment, and topology preparation for visualization.

## Protein complex with OLIVES
<hr>

To better preserve tertiary and quaternary structures in CG simulations, Gō-like models can be integrated with the Martini 3 force field, as introduced by Poma et al. (2017)<sup>[4]</sup>. In this step, we stabilize the structure of the CG protein complex using the OLIVES model, a Gō-like potential specifically designed to capture native hydrogen bonding patterns in Martini 3 proteins. Unlike traditional elastic networks or uniform Gō-models, OLIVES identifies native contacts capable of forming hydrogen bonds and introduces chemically informed Lennard-Jones interactions between donor–acceptor bead pairs. These interactions are separated into secondary (backbone–backbone) and tertiary (side-chain–backbone or side-chain–side-chain) networks, mimicking realistic intramolecular and interfacial hydrogen bonding <sup>[[15]](#references)</sup>.

OLIVES improves structural fidelity by recovering missing hydrogen bond contributions in the CG representation and eliminates the need for DSSP-based secondary structure restraints. It also allows stabilizing both tertiary and quaternary structures without extensive biasing, thus enabling more realistic folding, unfolding, and complex formation events. This approach is particularly valuable for protein–protein interfaces where standard CG models may underestimate stability without additional restraints
.


```bash
martinize2 -f 6ZH9_clean.pdb -o topol.top -x 6ZH9_CG.pdb -dssp /path/to/dssp -p backbone -ff martini3001 -merge all -ignh
```

```bash
python OLIVES_v2.0.1_M3.0.0.py -c 6ZH9_CG.pdb -i molecule_0.itp
```

Continue with [step 2](step-2-set-up-the-simulation-box). Then, run the following:

```bash
gmx make_ndx -f 6ZH9_CG.gro -o BB.ndx <<< 'del 0-19
a BB
q
'
```

```bash
gmx genrestr -f 6ZH9_CG.gro -n BB.ndx -o posre_BB.itp
```

Edit the topology as stated in [step1](#step-1-generate-coarse-grained-topology). Also modify the POSRES_FC with the command `sed` stated in the same step.

Create a copy of the topology
```bash
cp topol.top system.top
```

Proceed with [steps 3 to 7](#step-3-solvate-the-system) as described in the *Protein complex without a structure bias* section.

## Protein complex with GōMartini 3
<hr>

The enhanced GōMartini 3 implementation, described by Souza et al. (2025)<sup>[7]</sup>, improves on the original scheme with three key modifications:

* Virtual-site Gō beads: Gō interactions are applied to virtual sites co-located with backbone beads, treated as standard non-bonded pairs.

* Exclusion of native non-bonded terms: Default Martini interactions between Gō-connected residues are excluded to avoid double-counting.

* Distance bounds: Lower and upper cutoffs are applied to restrict Gō interactions within a defined range.

These virtual interactions are encoded in martini_v3.0.0.itp, and activated when #define GO_VIRT is included in the system topology. This works similarly to how POSRES is handled.

The Gō contact map can be calculated using the web server available at [GoContactMap](http://pomalab.ippt.pan.pl/GoContactMap/). Alternatively, recent versions of martinize2 also support the generation of Gō contact maps directly.

Upon using the `-go` flag, `martinize2` will:

* Read or generate the contact map
* Add Gō virtual beads
* Define Gō contact interactions
* Exclude native non-bonded terms

This makes it possible to generate a fully functional GōMartini model from a cleaned PDB structure with a single command, such as:

```bash
martinize2 -f 6ZH9_clean.pdb -o topol.top -x 6ZH9_CG.pdb -dssp /route/to/dssp -p backbone -ff martini3001 -go-eps 15.00 -go -maxwarn 4 -merge all -ignh -name molecule_0
```


The command shown above generates all required topology and structure files for performing GōMartini simulations of the protein using martinize2. This includes virtual Gō beads, native contact-based interactions, and the appropriate exclusions of default non-bonded terms between backbone beads connected by Gō-like bonds.

As mentioned earlier, the protein topology file (molecule0.itp) generated by martinize2 now includes additional virtual sites placed directly on top of the backbone beads. These virtual sites serve as anchoring points for the Gō-like interactions and are referenced in two auxiliary files:

* go_atomtypes.itp: contains an [ atomtypes ] directive that defines the properties of the virtual Gō beads.

* go_nbparams.itp: contains a [ nonbond_params ] directive that defines the Gō-like interactions between pairs of virtual sites, according to the native contact map.

To enable these additional non-bonded interactions during the simulation, you must insert the appropriate #include statements into the martini_v3.0.0.itp force field file. This ensures that the simulation engine recognizes the virtual Gō atom types and their interaction parameters.

Note:
If you are using the .itp files provided in the template folder, you do not need to manually add the #include statements for the GōMartini 3 model. These modifications have already been applied to the martini_v3.0.0.itp file included in that folder.

```bash
sed -i "s/\[ nonbond_params \]/\#ifdef GO_VIRT\n\#include \"go_atomtypes.itp\"\n\#endif\n\n\[ nonbond_params \]/" martini_v3.0.0.itp
```

```bash
echo -e "\n#ifdef GO_VIRT \n#include \"go_nbparams.itp\"\n#endif" >> martini_v3.0.0.itp
```

Important:
These modifications to martini_v3.0.0.itp should be done only once, regardless of how many proteins or simulations use Gō-like interactions. Repeating the inclusion or duplicating entries may lead to errors or unintended behavior during preprocessing.

The topol.top file must be updated to activate the GōMartini features by defining the GO_VIRT preprocessor variable. This ensures that the virtual sites and Gō-specific interaction parameters are included during simulation setup. The file should look as follows:

```bash
#define GO_VIRT
#include "martini_v3.0.0.itp"
#include "molecule_0.itp"
#include "martini_v3.0.0_ions_v1.itp"
#include "martini_v3.0.0_solvents_v1.itp"

[ system ]
SYSTEM NAME

[ molecules ]
molecule_0    1
```

This will ensure that the virtual site definitions and Gō-like nonbonded interactions are properly included in the simulation.

Proceed with [steps 2 to 7](#step-2-setup-the-simulation-box) as described in the *Protein complex without a structural bias* section.

## Part II. Protein complex under conformational changes: A nanomechanical study
<hr>



## AFM-SMFS captured by Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulation
<hr>

Nanomechanical characterisation probes how protein complexes respond to externally applied forces and uncovers dissociation pathways and energy barriers. By using SMD simulation within the Martini 3 CG framework augmented by GōMartini 3 virtual-site contacts<sup>[[7]](#references)</sup>, we attach defined pulling anchors to key residues and generate force-extension profiles at biologically relevant pulling speeds. This approach captures critical rupture events and force propagation pathways across the RBD and an engineered nanobody, highlighting the influence of variant mutations on mechanical stability <sup>[[2]](#references)</sup>. CG-SMD simulation bridges the gap between high-cost AA-MD simulations and experimental single molecular force spectroscopy (SMFS) <sup>[[9,10]](#references)</sup>.


### Protein alignment along the Z-axis

The complex can be prepared as described in section [Protein preparation](#protein-complex-preparation). All worked and template files for this tutorial can be download from [here](http://pomalab.ippt.pan.pl/web/complex2.zip). If you want to skip the preparation step, the file ready to use, `6ZH9_clean.pdb`,  is in the template folder.

We'll use `align_pdb.py` script to bring the pulling axis onto the z‑axis, and then we will add missing atoms and hydrogens with pdbfixer.

First, make sure you have `python 3`, `numpy`, `biopython` installed. In your terminal run:

```bash
python align_pdb.py <input_pdb> <output_pdb> <chain1> <res1> <chain2> <res2> --axis
```
```bash
python align_pdb_.py 6ZH9_clean.pdb 6ZH9_aligned.pdb E 195 F 128 --axis Z
```

This reads 6ZH9_clean.pdb, locates the two CA atoms you specified, computes the rotation that brings their connecting line onto the Z‑axis, applies that transform to every atom, and writes the result to 6ZH9_aligned.pdb.


To generate the Martini 3/GoMartini 3 model, please follow the instructions in the [Protein complex with GōMartini 3](#protein-complex-with-GōMartini3) section using the `6ZH9_aligned.pdb` file. From `martinize2` you'll get the new `6ZH9_CG.pdb` file.

### Step 2. Set up the simulation with a large box
Prepare the system for solvation and subsequent simulation with the following command:

```bash
gmx editconf -f 6ZH9_CG.pdb -center 5.000 5.000 6.000 -box 10.000 10.000 60.000 -o 6ZH9_WT_pull_CG.gro
```

Copy the topology and rename it as system.top


```bash
cp topol.top system.top
```

Proceed with [steps 3 to 6](#3-solvate-the-system) as described in the *Protein complex without a structural bias* section.

After step 6, we need to create an index file to apply the freeze protocol and to perform the CG-SDM:

```bash

Figure 6. Force–displacement profiles from CG-SMD simulations and AA-SMD reference. A) Mechanical unfolding profiles obtained using the native contacts. Each light gray line corresponds to an individual CG-SMD trajectory, and the green line represents the average. Inset: distribution of maximum rupture forces (F<sub>max</sub>) with fitted Gaussian (red). B) Same as panel A, but using high-frequency contacts. (C) Reference rupture force profile obtained from AA-SMD simulations, redrawn from <sup>[[13]](#references)</sup>. The pulling velocity was 10<sup>-3</sup> nm/ps for all cases.

Based on AA-SMD simulations from Gölcük et al. <sup>[13]</sup>, partial unfolding is not expected during unbinding. However, when native contacts are used to define the interface, they appear to overstabilize the complex, leading to an artificial partial unfolding of the H11–H4 region. Moreover, the resulting rupture forces are higher than those reported in the original AA-SMD data. To more accurately reproduce the rupture behavior of the complex, it is therefore necessary to rely on high-frequency contacts, which better reflect the dynamic stability observed in atomistic simulations.


## Protein complex with optimized GōMartini 3
<hr>

To better capture the nanomechanical behavior of this complex, we can use the AA-MD simulation used in Part I. This simulation will allow to determine the most persistent protein contacts, as described in <sup>[[8]](#references)</sup>. The AA-MD trajectory is located in the All-atom directory. We will use `traj_to_pdb.py` and `contact_calculation.py` (located in the template folder) to convert the trajectory to pdb format and to calculate high-frequency contacts as follows:

```bash
python traj_to_pdb.py  --trajectory 6ZH9_WT_dry_100.nc --topology 6ZH9_WT_dry.parm7  --ranges 1-195,195-323 --outdir . --stride 1
```

* --trajectory specifies the trajectory file (e.g., .xtc, .dcd, .nc). In this case, the file 6ZH9_WT_dry.nc is located in the 6ZH9_AA folder, with each frame representing 1 ns.

* --topology refers to the coordinate file (e.g., .pdb, .gro, parm7)

* --ranges defines the residue blocks corresponding to each chain (e.g., A: 2-196, B: 197-325)


The `contact_calculation.py` script automates the analysis of PDB trajectory frames to generate a CG topology with filtered high-frequency contacts. Then, it identifies the frame with the most high-frequency contacts to serve as input for CG. After that, it runs `martinize2` with `-go` bias on the selected reference frame.

```bash

python contact_calculation.py --short 3.0 --long 11.0 --cm /path/to/contact_map --type inter --cpus 15 --threshold 0.7 --merge all --dssp /usr/bin/mkdssp --go-eps 15.0
```

* --short and --long define the minimum and maximum distance cutoffs for contact detection (in Å).
* --cm points to the directory containing the contact_map executable. Available here [here](https://zenodo.org/records/3817447) or [here](https://github.com/Martini-Force-Field-Initiative/GoMartini/tree/main/ContactMapGenerator)
* --type sets the analysis scope (`both`, `intra`, or `inter`).
* --cpus defines the number of parallel workers for contact computation.
* --threshold is the minimum frequency to classify a contact as high-frequency (0.7 is recommended).
* --merge lists the chains to merge prior to running martinize2.
* --dssp provides the path to the DSSP executable (e.g., /usr/bin/mkdssp).
* --go-eps sets the epsilon value (in kJ/mol) for the Gō-model potential (a default value of 12.0 or 15.0 is suggested).
* --from indicates the origin of the topology (amber or charmm).


In this case, the file with the most contacts was frame_0095. Then, we need to align it to the Z-axis using the `align_pdb.py` script:

```bash
python align_pdb.py frame_0095_CG.pdb frame_0095_CG_aligned.pdb A 195 B 323 --axis Z
```

Procees with Step 2. Set up the simulation with a large box as described above. Then proceed with [steps 3 to 6](#3-solvate-the-system) as described in the *Protein complex without a structural bias* section. After that, run step 7 as stated above.
